# Note Taking

Heylo!

I have been wanting to improve my note taking skills since I was in my undergrad. While searching the internet about techniques to enhance note taking, I particularly found these two articles very interesting. I plan on trying both the approches and sticking to the one that suits me.

1. Cornell Note Taking System
    * https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/
2. Stenography
    * https://owlcation.com/humanities/Why-There-is-a-Line-Down-The-Middle-of-Steno-Pad-Book

Do check these out. Hope you found this information useful.
