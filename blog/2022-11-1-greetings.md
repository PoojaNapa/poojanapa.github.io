Hi!

I am Pooja and this is my portfolio website. Through this website, I wish to interact, share and discuss my projects and areas of interest with everyone of you.

I would like to welcome you to join me on my "Learn something new everyday" mission. I would like to explore various topics including AI/ML/DL/NLP, coding and other Computer Science. I also like to read and summarize research papers. Apart from these, I am interested in the fields of law and space and I love to watch cricket matches and thriller series/movies and books.

Thanks and hope you had a great read!
