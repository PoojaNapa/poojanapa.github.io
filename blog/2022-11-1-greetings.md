Heylo!

I am Pooja and this is my portfolio website. Through this website, I wish to interact, share and discuss my projects and areas of interest with everyone of you.

I would like to welcome you to join me on my "Learn something new everyday" mission. I would like to explore various concepts related to AI and ML, programming languages and other topics related to Computer Science. I also like to read and summarize research papers that I read from time to time. Apart from these technical aspects, I am interested in the fields of law and space. I love watching cricket matches and thriller series and movies.

Thank you!
